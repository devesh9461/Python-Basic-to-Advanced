Python is a high-level programming language known for its simple and readable syntax. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum to make programming easy to learn and use.

It allows writing programs with fewer lines of code, improving readability.
It automatically detects variable types at runtime, eliminating the need for explicit declarations.
It is used in web development, data analysis, automation, and many other fields.
It supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming styles.

Understanding Hello World Program in Python
# This is a comment. It will not be executed.
print("Hello, World!")
Output:
Hello, World!


How does this work:
print-hello-world
print() is a built-in Python function that instructs the computer to display text on the screen.
"Hello, World!" is a string, which is a sequence of text. In Python, strings are enclosed in quotes (either single ' or double ").

Indentation in Python
In Python, Indentation is used to define blocks of code. It indicates to the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to the same block. All statements
with the same level of indentation are treated as part of the same code block. Indentation is created using whitespace at the beginning of each line, and the commonly 
accepted convention is to use four spaces per indentation level.

print("I have no Indentation ")
    print("I have tab Indentation ")
Output:

ERROR!
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<main.py>", line 2
    print("I have tab Indentation ")
IndentationError: unexpected indent

Explanation:

The first print statement has no indentation, so it is correctly executed.
The second print statement has tab indentation, but it doesn't belong to a new block of code. Python expects the indentation level to be consistent within the same block. This inconsistency causes an IndentationError.
