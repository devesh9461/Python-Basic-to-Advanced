"""Python is a high-level programming language known for its simple and readable syntax. It was created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum to make programming easy to learn and use.

   It allows writing programs with fewer lines of code, improving readability.
   It automatically detects variable types at runtime, eliminating the need for explicit declarations.
   It is used in web development, data analysis, automation, and many other fields.
   It supports object-oriented, functional, and procedural programming styles."""

# This is a comment. It will not be executed.
print("Hello, World!")

# print() is a built-in Python function that instructs the computer to display text on the screen.
# "Hello, World!" is a string, which is a sequence of text. In Python, strings are enclosed in quotes (either single ' or double ").

'''Indentation in Python

   In Python, Indentation is used to define blocks of code. It indicates to the Python interpreter that a group of statements belongs to the same block. All statements with the same level of 
   indentation are treated as part of the same code block. Indentation is created using whitespace at the beginning of each line, and the commonly accepted convention is to use four spaces
   per indentation level.'''

"""print("I have no Indentation ")
   print("I have tab Indentation ")"""

"""The first print statement has no indentation, so it is correctly executed.
The second print statement has tab indentation, but it doesn't belong to a new block of code. 
Python expects the indentation level to be consistent within the same block.
This inconsistency causes an IndentationError."""

Scripting languages :- 
Scripting languages is a type of programming language designed for a runtime system to automate the execution of tasks. It uses an interpreter to convert sourcecode into machine code.
Do not create .exe file. There are low maintence Cost.
All the scipting languages are programming languages. 

Programming language :- 
A programming language is a computer language that is used to communicate with computer using a set of instruction. 
These generate .exe file. 
Not all the programming languages are Scripting languages. 
There are high maintence cost.




Python Appilcations :-  

1. Web Applications :- we can use python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email message, request etc. One of py web-framework named Django is used on Instagram python  provides many useful frameworks, and these Django and pyramid framework usefull heavy applications. Flask and Bottle (micro-framework).

2. Desktop based applications
3. software development
4. scientific and Numeric
5. Bussiness Appilication
6. Audio or Video based applications
7. 3D CAD Applications 


Structure of python code :- 

// Import statements
// Functions definitions
// Program Statements
