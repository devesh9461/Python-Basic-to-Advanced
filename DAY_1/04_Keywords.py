'''Keywords in Python are special reserved words that are part of the language itself. They define the rules and structure of Python programs which means you cannot use them as names for your variables, functions, classes or any other identifiers.

Getting List of all Python keywords
We can also get all the keyword names using the below code.


import keyword
print("The list of keywords are : ")
print(keyword.kwlist)'''

# Identify Python Keywords
'''Ways to identify Python Keywords are:

  With Syntax Highlighting: Most of IDEs provide syntax-highlight feature. You can see Keywords appearing in different color or style.
  Look for SyntaxError: This error will encounter if you have used any keyword incorrectly. Keywords can not be used as identifiers like variable or a function name.
  Keywords as Variable Names
  If we attempt to use a keyword as a variable, Python will raise a SyntaxError. Let's look at an example:

  for = 10 
  print(for)'''

'''#  Category	Keywords

   Value Keywords ==> True, False, None
   Operator Keywords ==> and, or, not, is, in
   Control Flow Keywords ==> if, else, elif, for, while, break, continue, pass, try, except, finally, raise, assert
   Function and Class ==> def, return, lambda, yield, class
   Context Management ==> with, as
   Import and Module ==> import, from
   Scope and Namespace ==> global, nonlocal
   Async Programming ==> async, await

# Keywords vs Identifiers

''' 
Keywords: 
1. Reserved words in Python that have a specific meaning.
2. Cannot be used as variable names.
3. Examples: if, else, for, while.
4. Examples: if, else, for, while.
5. They cannot be redefined or changed.	
'''

'''
Identifiers: 
1. Names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.
2. Can be used as variable names if not a keyword.
3. Examples: x, number, sum, result.
4. User-defined, meaningful names in the code.
5. Can be defined and redefined by the programmer.
'''

# Variables vs Keywords

'''
Variables:
1. Used to store data.
2. Can be created, modified, and deleted by the programmer.
3. Examples: x, age, name.
4. Hold values that are manipulated in the program.	
5. Variable names must follow naming rules but are otherwise flexible.
'''

'''
Keywords:
1. Reserved words with predefined meanings in Python.
2. Cannot be modified or used as variable names.
3. Examples: if, while, for.
4. Used to define the structure of Python code.
5. Fixed by Python language and cannot be altered.
