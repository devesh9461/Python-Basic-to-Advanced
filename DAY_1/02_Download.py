"""The first step towards learning Python is to install it on your system. Whether you're using Windows, macOS, or Linux, this guide walks you through the process of downloading and installing the latest Python 3 version.
   In this guide, we'll cover each step required to get Python up and running on your machine, no matter the operating system you're using.

   To understand how to download and install Python, you need to know what Python is and where it is installed in your system. Let's look at few points:

   1. Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
   2. Every release of Python is open-source. Python releases have also been compatible with General Public License (GPL).
   3. Any version of Python can be downloaded from the Python Software Foundation website at python.org.
   4. Most languages, notably Linux, provide a package manager through which you can directly install Python on your Operating System

   ===> How to Download and Install Python on Windows
         Note: The below process of downloading and installing Python in Windows works for both of the Windows 10 as well as Windows 11.


         Step 1: Download Python for Windows
         Open your browser and visit the Python download page: python.org/downloads.
         Select the latest Python 3 version, such as Python 3.13.1 (or whichever is the latest stable version available).
         Click on the version to download the installer (a .exe file for Windows).
         
         Step 2: Run the Python Installer
         Once the download is complete, run the installer program. On Windows, it will typically be a .exe file.
         Make sure to mark Add Python to PATH otherwise you will have to do it explicitly. It will start installing Python on Windows.
         After installation is complete click on Close.
         
         Step 3: Running Python Shell on Windows
         After installing Python, we can launch the Python Shell by searching for "IDLE" in the "Start" menu and clicking on it.
