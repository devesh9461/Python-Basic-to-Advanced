Keywords :- Keywords in Python are special reserved words that are part of the language itself. They define the rules and structure of Python programs which means you cannot use them as names for your variables, functions, classes or any other identifiers.

##  Keywords vs Identifiers

Keywords	                                                           Identifiers
Reserved words in Python that have a specific meaning.	             Names given to variables, functions, classes, etc.
Cannot be used as variable names.	                                   Can be used as variable names if not a keyword.
Examples: if, else, for, while	                                     Examples: x, number, sum, result
Part of the Python syntax.	                                         User-defined, meaningful names in the code.
They cannot be redefined or changed.	                               Can be defined and redefined by the programmer.



## Variables vs Keywords

Variables	                                                                Keywords
Used to store data.	                                                      Reserved words with predefined meanings in Python.
Can be created, modified, and deleted by the programmer.	                Cannot be modified or used as variable names.
Examples: x, age, name	                                                  Examples: if, while, for
Hold values that are manipulated in the program.	                        Used to define the structure of Python code.
Variable names must follow naming rules but are otherwise flexible.	      Fixed by Python language and cannot be altered.
