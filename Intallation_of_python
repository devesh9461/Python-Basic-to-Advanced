1. What is the Python Interpreter?

The Interpreter is the software that translates your Python code into instructions the computer can understand and execute.

When you "download Python," you are actually downloading this interpreter.

2. Steps to Download & Install (Windows)
Step 1: Go to the Official Website

Open your web browser.

Visit: python.org/downloads

The site usually detects your OS automatically. Click the big yellow button that says "Download Python 3.x.x" (e.g., 3.12.0).

Step 2: Run the Installer (Crucial Step!)

Open the downloaded file (usually named python-3.x.x-amd64.exe).

⚠ IMPORTANT: Before clicking anything else, look at the bottom of the window.

Check the box: [✓] Add Python.exe to PATH.

Note: If you miss this, you won't be able to run Python easily from the command line later.

Click "Install Now".

Step 3: Finish Installation

Wait for the progress bar to finish.

Once you see "Setup was successful," click Close.
